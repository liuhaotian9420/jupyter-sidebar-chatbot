# Feature Adding Workflow

Before implementing a new feature, please follow these steps:

1.  **Understand the Context:** Review the project structure and component interactions detailed in the main project documentation: [docs/README.md](mdc:docs/README.md). This file also links to detailed documentation for specific modules.
2.  **Be Mindful of Paths:** Remember the current workspace root and the relative paths to key directories like `backend/src/` and `jupyter-lab-extension/src/`.
3.  **Plan and Prioritize:**
    *   Break down the feature into smaller, manageable tasks.
    *   Evaluate the priority of each task (e.g., P0, P1, P2).
    *   Record the feature by a designated name that should be approved by the user
    *   Document these tasks and their priorities in [FEAT_TODO.md](mdc:FEAT_TODO.md) with the current timestamp
4.  **Leverage Existing Code:** Prioritize extending or modifying existing components and functions over creating entirely new ones whenever feasible. This promotes code reuse and maintainability.
5.  **Plan for Testing:** Add specific testing tasks for the new feature to the testing checklist: [TESTING_TODO.md](mdc:TESTING_TODO.md). Ensure unit, integration, and UI tests are considered.
