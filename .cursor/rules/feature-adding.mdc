# Feature Adding Workflow

Before implementing a new feature, please follow these steps:

1.  **Understand the Context:** Review the project structure and component interactions detailed in the main project documentation: [docs/README.md](mdc:docs/README.md). This file also links to detailed documentation for specific modules.
2.  **Be Mindful of Paths:** Remember the current workspace root and the relative paths to key directories like `backend/src/` and `jupyter-lab-extension/src/`.
3.  **Plan and Prioritize:**
    *   Break down the feature into smaller, manageable tasks.
    *   Evaluate the priority of each task (e.g., P0, P1, P2).
    *   Record the feature by a designated name that should be approved by the user
    *   Document these tasks and their priorities in [FEAT_TODO.md](mdc:FEAT_TODO.md) with the current timestamp
4.  **Leverage Existing Code:** Prioritize extending or modifying existing components and functions over creating entirely new ones whenever feasible. This promotes code reuse and maintainability.
5.  **Plan for Testing:** Add specific testing tasks for the new feature to the testing checklist: [TESTING_TODO.md](mdc:TESTING_TODO.md). Ensure unit, integration, and UI tests are considered.


# Feature Implementation Workflow

While adding features or implementing requests documented in [FEAT_TODO.md](mdc:FEAT_TODO.md):

1.  **Complete One Task:** Focus on implementing one task from the feature list at a time, prioritizing based on the plan (e.g., P0, P1).
2.  **Seek Confirmation:** After successfully implementing a single task, pause and explicitly ask the user for confirmation before proceeding to the next task.
3.  **Update TODO List:** Once the user confirms the task completion, update the corresponding checklist item in [FEAT_TODO.md](mdc:FEAT_TODO.md) by marking it as done (e.g., `[x]`).
4.  **Commit Changes:** After updating [FEAT_TODO.md](mdc:FEAT_TODO.md), use git to commit the changes related to the completed task. The commit message should follow the format: `feat:{feature name}-{task short name}`. Replace `{feature name}` with the relevant feature identifier (e.g., `inline-ref-widgets`) and `{task short name}` with a concise description of the task (e.g., `detect-at-symbol`).
