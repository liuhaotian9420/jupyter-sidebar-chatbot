# General Coding Style Guidelines

When writing or modifying code, please adhere to the following principles:

1.  **Track Progress with TODOs:** If work is incomplete or requires future attention, leave a `TODO` comment in the code. Briefly document the purpose or next steps associated with the TODO, either in the comment itself or linked to an issue/task tracker if applicable.
2.  **Preserve Potentially Used Code:** Exercise caution before deleting code that appears unused. It might be conditionally used, part of a feature branch, or referenced dynamically. If unsure, comment it out with an explanation or confirm its redundancy thoroughly before removal.
