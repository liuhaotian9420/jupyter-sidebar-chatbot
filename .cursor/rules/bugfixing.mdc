# Frontend Bugfix Build Reminder

When fixing bugs, especially those involving changes within the `jupyter-lab-extension/` directory:

1.  **Rebuild the Extension:** After making changes to the TypeScript frontend code ([jupyter-lab-extension/src](mdc:jupyter-lab-extension/src)), remember to rebuild the extension using the command `jlpm build` in the `jupyter-lab-extension` directory to see the effects.
