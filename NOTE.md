### Refactoring JupyterLab Sidebar UI

**Objective:**
Consolidate the JupyterLab sidebar UI by implementing a multi-level pop-up menu for context insertion, enabling file and directory browsing, and enhancing user experience through improved navigation and styling. Complete the core functionality and refine the interface while preparing for future enhancements.

### Summary of Work Done

#### Features Modified, Added, or Removed
- **Consolidated Action Buttons**: Replaced the separate Code, Cell, File, and Directory action buttons with a single "@" button that triggers a multi-level pop-up menu.
- **Multi-Level Pop-Up Menu**: Implemented a pop-up menu that allows users to navigate between different contexts (Code, Cell, File, Directory) and select items.
- **File and Directory Browsing**: Added functionality to browse files and directories, including:
  - Listing items in the current directory based on user selection.
  - Implementing back navigation and displaying the current path.
- **Dynamic Context Handling**: Enhanced the `listCurrentDirectoryContents` method to accept a filter parameter for listing files and directories.

#### Dependencies and APIs
- **JupyterLab APIs**: Utilized JupyterLab's document manager and notebook tracker to retrieve the current active cell and manage file browsing.
- **CodeMirror**: Used for handling text selection within JupyterLab cells.

#### Design Decisions
- **State Management**: Introduced state variables (`currentMenuLevel`, `currentMenuPath`, `menuHistory`) to manage navigation within the pop-up menu.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented basic error handling for directory listing, including messages for empty directories or inaccessible paths.

#### Environmental Variables
- **Development Environment**: The project is developed using TypeScript, with a focus on JupyterLab extensions.
- **Build Tool**: Utilized `jlpm` (Yarn) for building the extension.

#### Security Preferences
- No specific security preferences were discussed, but standard practices for handling user inputs and file access should be maintained.

#### Special User Requests and Preferences
- The user requested a consolidated UI with a multi-level menu for better context management.
- Future enhancements could include file content previews and improved error handling.

#### Existing Blockers and Bugs
- No significant blockers or bugs were identified during the conversation. The last encountered issue was a duplicate method declaration, which has been resolved.

#### Next Steps to Solve the Problem
1. **Phase 3 (File Content Preview)**: Consider implementing a way to preview file content directly from the menu.
2. **Phase 4 (Refinement)**:
   - Add icons to menu items for better visual representation.
   - Review and refine error handling and user feedback mechanisms.
   - Conduct thorough testing in various scenarios to ensure robustness.
3. **Documentation**: Update any relevant documentation to reflect the changes made during this session.

### Conclusion
The implementation of the multi-level pop-up menu is complete, and the core functionality for browsing files and directories is operational. The next steps involve refining the user experience and considering additional features. This summary captures all necessary context to seamlessly continue development in future sessions.
